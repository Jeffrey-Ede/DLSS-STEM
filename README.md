# Deep Learning Supersampled Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (DLSS-STEM)

Repository for the paper "Deep Learning Supersampled Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy".

Pretrained models for unified generators are available [here](https://mycloud-test.warwick.ac.uk/s/rbgCbZdXWqzSLCf). The download password is "W4rw1ck3m!" (without quotations). 

The STEM Crops dataset is available [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/microscopy/research/machinelearning/).

A quick implementation of a live system is in the first_impl folder. Pre-trained models can be downloaded separately. A refined, lower-latency system will be implemented and packaged in a few months after we updgrade our DigitalMicrograph/GMS software.
